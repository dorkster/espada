This is a simple space shooter that I made with C and SDL.

Dependencies:
SDL
SDL_image
SDL_ttf
SDL_mixer
iniparser (Your distro's package manager might not have this, so you can get it here: http://ndevilla.free.fr/iniparser/)

Controls (main menu):
Arrow keys = Move cursor vertically / Increase & decrease settings
Z = Accept selection

Controls (ingame):
Arrow keys = Movement
Z = Fire
P or ESC = Pause
